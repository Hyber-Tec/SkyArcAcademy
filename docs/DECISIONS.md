# Decisions

Goo's answers and the calls already made. They win over the brief and the review (CLAUDE.md). Add new answers at the
end of the matching section, with the date.

## 1. Product (from the brief and the kickoff meeting, Oct 13, 2026)

- **One academy.** No branch creation, no super-admin layer.
- **Web first.** The phone app (admin, coach, parent, student) is Phase 2; data and APIs stay ready for it.
- **No landing page yet.** The homepage is a placeholder: logo, one line, Log in, Book a trial. Goo designs the
  landing page last.
- **Progress reports are uploaded by hand** (bulk SIUS PDFs with a review table, paper-target photos). No SIUS
  integration. Only official evaluations are uploaded (about 1–3 per student per month), starting fresh.
- **Coaches clock in and out at a kiosk** with a PIN (stored hashed, never logged).
- **Terminology:** Coach, Class, Academy, Makeup (MU), Position (Standing / Kneeling / Prone).
- **Korean and English** on every parent-facing screen (parent portal, trial booking, homepage).
- Values the academy hasn't sent yet (hours, rules, capacity, pay) are **settings with sensible defaults**, never hard-coded.
- **Time zone: America/New_York.** The academy is at 730 Peachtree Industrial Blvd, Suwanee, GA (skyarcacademy.com,
  checked 2026-10-15). It is the academy's time-zone setting, used for every class time, the kiosk and payroll.

## 2. Setup (2026-10-15)

- **Repository:** https://github.com/Hyber-Tec/SkyArcAcademy, in the `SkyArcAcademy` folder itself. The client
  material in the folder is git-ignored. The brief is committed with students' names removed from its asset list;
  the meeting notes stay local.
- **Public since 2026-10-15** (Goo: GitHub Actions minutes are unlimited for public repositories). Everything
  committed is world-readable, so client-internal details (people's names, contacts, timeline, money) and findings
  about other HyberTec products stay in the git-ignored `docs/internal/` on Goo's Mac mini, and the public brief and
  review name the academy's people by role.
- **GitHub account:** only `goochoi913` in this folder (repo-local `user.name`/`user.email` and a credential helper
  using goochoi913's `gh` token), never the work account `goo913`.
- **Firebase project `skyarcacademy`:** sign-in with Google and email/password; Firestore in `nam5`; Realtime
  Database in `us-central1`; Hosting at `skyarcacademy.web.app`. Nothing uses the Realtime Database yet, so its
  rules stay deny-all until a feature needs it.
- **Cloud Storage** default bucket `skyarcacademy.firebasestorage.app` in **`us-central1`** (Goo), next to the
  Realtime Database and Cloud Functions, in Google's free tier region.
- **Deploys:** GitHub deploys `main` after CI passes, signed in to Google Cloud through Workload Identity Federation
  (no service-account keys). See `docs/DEPLOY.md`.
- **Enforcing pull requests:** a ruleset on `main` requires a pull request and green CI (Goo), added with the fork's
  final CI. Code-owner approval stays a convention: GitHub doesn't let authors approve their own pull requests.

## 3. The fork (2026-10-15, Goo)

- **Plan confirmed** (`docs/HYBERCRM_REVIEW.md`): one fixed academy internally (`branches/skyarc`), no branch or
  Super Admin UI, flat URLs (`/admin`, `/coach`, `/parent`, `/kiosk`, `/trial`), the tutoring features removed.
- **Copy, then strip:** an exact import of HyberCRM `d659d34` as its own commit, then the Sky Arc changes.
- **No hidden Super Admin.** HyberTec's support access is an ordinary owner login that the academy can see on the
  Account page and remove at handover.
- **First account:** Goo (goochoi913@gmail.com) as owner while the app is built; the academy's owner and manager
  are invited from the Account page.
